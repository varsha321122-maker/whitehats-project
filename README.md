# whitehats-project

**Name:** Varsha

I want to join Whitehats because I am very interested in cybersecurity and I want to learn how to protect systems from cyber attacks. I think Whitehats will help me learn new skills, work with other learners, and build good projects that help make the internet safer.

**Cybersecurity Incident I Recently Read About:**  
I read about a cyber attack on the IT systems of Irish health services, where hackers used ransomware to block access to systems and demanded money. This attack caused delays in hospital services and made staff use paper records because computers were locked. This incident showed how important it is to protect critical systems and data from attackers.
